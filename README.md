E-commerce Website Built with Django!

Excited to share my semester project: a full-fledged e-commerce web application built with Django! 

This project was a fantastic learning experience, diving deep into both front-end and back-end development.

Here's the tech stack breakdown:

Backend:
Django (Python's web framework) for handling functionalities like user interaction and data processing.
Frontend:
HTML & CSS for building the website's structure and styling.
JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic elements.

Key Features & Technologies:

1. Persistent Shopping Cart (Unauthenticated Users): Leveraged the power of JavaScript and browser cookies to create a shopping cart functionality even for users who haven't signed in. This ensures a smoother user experience by letting them add and remove items without needing an account.

2. Seamless Checkout Process:
Implemented API calls to bridge the gap between the user's checkout form on the front-end (built with HTML) and the back-end Django functions.
Data is sent securely in JSON format using specific routing URLs within Django.

3. Dynamic Cart Management:
Crafted interactive buttons using JavaScript and Bootstrap to allow users to adjust the number of items in their cart directly on the cart page.
This keeps the cart updated in real time, providing a more user-friendly experience.

Learning Curve & Growth:
Following Dennis Ivy's insightful Django tutorials played a pivotal role in building this project.

Overall, this project challenged me to integrate various technologies and tackle real-world development scenarios. It was incredibly rewarding to see a fully functional e-commerce application come to life!
